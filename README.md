## ML

### Prerequisits

Install all the requirements

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generating models

Models are generated by running [`ML/src/main.py`](ML/src/main.py) script.

`RAW_DATA_PATH` indicates dataset which is used for training.

Currently script is set to use fixed hyperparameters to speed up training.
To find best model for new data use `models.search_model` instead (uncoment following code).

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from models import search_model
...
model = RandomForestRegressor(max_features="log2", n_estimators=180, n_jobs=-1)
model.fit(X, y)
# model = search_model(X, y)
```
